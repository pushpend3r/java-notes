A variable is the name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.
- the value stored in the variable can be changed during the execution of the program.
- all the operations done on the variable directly effects the value in the memory location.
- In Java, all variables must be declared before use.

**Syntax -** 
```cpp
int main;
```

here `int` is the data type means which type of data this variable stores.
`main` is the name of the variable.

In the above code we are declaring the variable so that jvm knows it exists.

When we are just declaring the variable it gets it's value based upon the data type's default value.

Rules of naming variable names - [[Basics#Rules for defining Identifiers|here]].

So `int name;` means just declaring the variable, and `int name = "Pushpender Singh";` means declaring and as well as initializing the variable.
