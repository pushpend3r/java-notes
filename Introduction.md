- It is the programming language.
- developed by James Gosling in 1995 at Sun Microsystems which was acquired by Orcale in 2010.
- At first it called *Oak* then *Green* then finally *Java* [Java is name of a coffee].
- It is Object Oriented but not Pure Object Oriented because not everything is in it an object as it supports primitive data types (like `int`, `char` etc) [link](https://www.java67.com/2014/03/is-java-pure-object-oriented-programming-language.html).
- It is similar to C/C++. But doesn't provide low level programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.
- It is use to make mobile app, desktop app, web app, enterprise app and many more.

Java code sample - 

```java
public class Main {
 public static void main (String args[]) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```

### Features
- ##### *Simple* 
	Java is easy to learn and its syntax is clear and concise.
- ##### *Platform-independent*
	Platform is the environment where your application runs like Windows, Linux, Mac etc. Java app runs on any platform as long as it has JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
- ##### *OOP*
	Objects helps us to visualize real world entities. Every object can contain properties and methods.
- ##### *Multi-threaded*
	perform many tasks at once by defining multiple threads.
	> A thread is a path of execution within a process. A process can contain multiple threads.
	> The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads
	> They are also known as Lightweight Process. - [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/thread-in-operating-system/)
