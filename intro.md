function - a piece of code that perform a task

every java should have at least one function that we call 'main' function.

class is a container of related function.

package is a container of related classes.

every java program should have a class that contains main function that class we call 'Main' class.

method is a function that is part of a class.

in java there are various naming convensions (not rules)

classes follows PascalNamingConvension - every word have capital first letter

functions follows camalNamingConvension - every word have capital first letter except first word.

System.out.println

here system = class, out = field, Println = method

compliation step - 
.java --> bytecode(.class) --> run on jre(java runtime environment)

bytecode can run on any platform either windows, linux, mac or anything that have jre.

jre have a component called jvm (java virtual machine) which are responsible for running bytecode

because of the bytecode java programs are platform independent.

javac => java compiler --> to convert .java file to bytecode (.class file) use javac executable.

> javac FILENAME.java

java => jre --> run the bytecode
